              <p>I'm currently in my final year of studies at the University of Western Ontario. Throughout my academic journey, I've built a solid foundation in computer science principles, software development, and problem solving skills. Although though my time as a student is ending, I firmly believe in being a lifelong learner. My expertise currently lies with <strong>Fullstack Development</strong>, <strong>Relational Databases</strong>, <strong>DevOps</strong>, and <strong>Machine Learning/AI</strong>.</p>
              <p>With over a year of professional experience, I've had the privelege of developing and maintaining software to meet real-world business needs. I've had the opportunity to collaborate with professionals from various backgrounds and work closely with vendors, strengthening my communication and teamwork skills in cross-functional environments. My experience in the non-profit sector has been especially valuable, as I've learned the importance of working towards meaningful goals, creating real, positive change within our society.</p>
              <p>I am seriously passionate about the work that I do, and I'm always looking for ways to improve myself. I try to take full ownership of projects from start to end, maintaining both a big-picture perspective and detail oriented view. I embrace challenging tasks, and look forward to taking on projects outside of my comfort zone.
